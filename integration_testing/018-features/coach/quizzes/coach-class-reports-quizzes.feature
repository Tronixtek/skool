Feature: Coach reviews learner reports for quizzes
  Coach needs to be able to see the quiz report details with the progress and score for each learner

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a coach
      And I am at *Coach - '<class>' > Quizzes*
      And there are multiple quizzes assigned to a class, group, individual recipients
      And there are quizzes with all three completion statuses

  Scenario: Coach can review a quiz report
    When I click on the title of a quiz
    Then I see the quiz details page
    	And I see the quiz title, the *Preview* button and the *...* button next to it
    	And I see the side panel with *Recipients*, *Average score*, *Report visibility*, *Class*, *Section order*, *Size*, *Date created*
    	And I see the *Learners* tab with the learners table
    	And there are the following columns: *Name*, *Progress*, *Sore* and *Groups*
    	And I see the *Difficult questions* tab
    When I click on the name of a learner who has completed the quiz
    Then I see the quiz score card
    	And I can see the *Answer history* of the learner
    When I click the back arrow
    Then I am back at the quiz details page
    When I click on the *Difficult questions* tab
    Then I see a table with the difficult questions
    	And I see the following columns: *Question*, *Help needed*

  		And there are learners who have not started, started or completed a quiz
  	When I click the *Export as CSV* icon
  		And I save the exported CSV file to the device
  		And I open the CSV file to see the data
